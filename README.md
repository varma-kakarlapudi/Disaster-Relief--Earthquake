# Disaster-Relief--Earthquake

This was done on 21-03-2019 for a Hackathon " Code4Good " hosted by #NTTData" 
GDS Banglore ( https://www.nttdata.com/global/en/# ) in colloboration with Techgig .

After attempting an written test (online) on techgig website based on Disasters and 
Artificial Intelligence ,we were shortlisted and then we formed a team of 3 people (Varma kakarlapudi ,Sai kiran , hemanth kumar) . 

Then we were given 2 Mentors from NTT Data ( Abdul Kabir Sheik and Niravhra Chatterjee ) to guide us. 
we have gone through the problem statements  and
Finally we choose the Earthquake Disaster Management and thought of Predicting the Occurence of the Earthquake
provided for the Dataset given . So that the Lives of people can be saved and helping govt. financially

Anova_database                                ----  is the  Trained Dataset 
Anova_project_techgig_naive_bayes             ----  python code using Naive_bayes classifier
Anova_project_techgig_logistic_regression     ----  python code using logistic_regression

code_naive bayes                              ----  final code submitted with all changes

I_D_E_A  :

      Our main idea is to show the visualization of a nearby earthquakes of a 
      given location (latitude n longitude ) from the given database of previous 
      100 years of Eathquake data only .so that we will visually show the world 
      map with the help of Basemap library from Matplotlib toolkit and threby 
      finding the Magnitude(avg ) and finally suggesting the end user or customer
      like is it safe to construct buildings in that location or is it safe to invest
      in that location and additionally we suggest them to build wooden houses and
      in some areas to incerase the ductibility of the building by increasing the 
      steel content and other materials , 
      so that the building can withstand minor earthquakes .
      
      An extension to this project can also be done like using seismographs 
      or seismometers to detect and record earthquakes . 
      so that human loss can be minimized .



In addition to this we have made a vedio and a ppt for this Disaster relief in the below google drive link .
